        Tony Rosenberg (vocalist / lyricist) and Peter Jenner (songwriter / guitarist) have
        been playing together for almost three years now, and writing as <div class="flint">Flint.</div> for almost
        two.
        <br><br>
        John Doyle (bass) and Brian Foulds (drums) joined the band in late 2020 and the
        fruit of their efforts is (will be) the bandâ€™s debut EP, a five-song compilation of rock
        music with an edge.
        <br><br>
        <div class="flint">Flint.</div> began as a desire to create a sound that is not obvious, but which traverses
        several realms of rock. Odd tunings, unexpected chord progressions, peculiar
        percussion are blended carefully with lyrical musings that take listeners on a roller
        coaster ride of moods, feelings and ideas. At one moment, a listener may hear
        something remotely familiar; however, before they can digest the sound, it is
        transformed into something unforeseen, or was it?
